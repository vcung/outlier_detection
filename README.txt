Final project for Tufts' Intro to Machine Learning, Spring 2014

Synthetic_dataset1 tests whether the program can detect outliers in the middle of a cluster. 
The dataset was manually constructed; The points form a circle around an outlier in the
middle of the circle, with an additional outlier below the circle.

Synthetic_dataset2 was manually contructed. It has 6 outliers.

To run the program:

python outlier_detection.py [datafile.arff name] [output file name]
